An interest in interdisciplinary and alternative approaches to performance, a passion for free improvisation, and a desire to explore contemporary repertoire for guitar and percussion are the hallmarks of the Merors duo.\n Officially formed in 2021, the Merors duo presents a repertoire of \"solo\" and \"duo\" pieces that, connected through performative or narrative elements, show the audience new ways of interpreting and performing music. \nPerforming in important concert venues in Italy and Austria, including the Auditorium of the Conservatorio \"G. Verdi\" in Como and the Foyer of the Brucknerhaus in Linz, in December 2022 Duo Merors staged the interdisciplinary performance \"Träume sind die nächtlichen Spiegel der Seele\" as result of a close collaboration with actress Lena Sophie Knapp and guitarist and theater scholar Svetoslav Stoychev.\n Open to all kinds of artistic contamination, Duo Merors has also collaborated with and commissioned various composers, including Fredrik Storsveen, Stefan Lischewski, Luca Mazzilli, Yuheng Chen, Anna Wielend, Maria Pérez, Alireza Shahabolmolkfard, Mikolasek Michael.",
